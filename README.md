Electrochip 🚀
Description 💻
Electrochip is my very first web development project, created solely using basic HTML and CSS.
While it isn't fully responsive, this project marks the beginning of my journey in web development.
Through this project, I not only learned how to build a website but also started exploring the foundational technologies used in modern web development.
Additionally, I practiced cloning a project as part of this process, which helped me enhance my understanding of web development workflows.
